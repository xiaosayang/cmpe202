In lab 6, I used the composite pattern to implement this program. In the composite design pattern, each component of the customer order is considered an object, and by adding all these objects together to created the order. With this design, I have created the participants including the Component class as interface, Leaf and Composite classes implement the Component interface and the Client class to compose the order together, as well as other child classes to represent the burger type, toppings and fries.
