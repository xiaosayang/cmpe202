The orginal strategy pattern example has one interface with the abstract method doOperations(), and class objects' behave differently based on the function's overrided implementation of doOperation(). Besides the classes for addition, substraction, and multiplication, there is the context class for creating object that demonstrates the change of behavior once the strategy changes.


The functional version of the program with lambda only has functional interfaces and the implementation is less verbose. The functions from the functional interfaces are implemented in lambda and being used based on demand. There is only one object needs to be created to demonstrated the change in object behavior, whereas in the original example, a new object is needed inorder to test each of the addition, substraction, and multiplication behaviors.
